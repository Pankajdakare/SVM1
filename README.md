# SVM1
SUPPPORT VECTOR MACHINE 
Support Vector Machine (SVM) Analysis
Overview
This Jupyter Notebook (SVM.ipynb) provides a comprehensive analysis using Support Vector Machines (SVM) on the Titanic dataset. The notebook includes data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

Structure
The notebook is organized into the following sections:

Imports and Settings: Importing necessary libraries and setting configurations.
Data Loading: Loading the Titanic dataset (titanic_new.csv).
Data Cleaning: Cleaning the data by handling missing values and dropping unnecessary columns.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducting EDA to understand the data distribution and relationships.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features and transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
Model Training: Training the SVM model with the processed data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model using appropriate metrics and visualizations.
Conclusion: Summarizing the findings and potential next steps.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
